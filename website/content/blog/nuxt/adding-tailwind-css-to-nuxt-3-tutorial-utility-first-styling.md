## Introduction

In this post, we'll introduce Nuxt Tailwind, a package for the Tailwind CSS library.

## Tailwind

Tailwind is a powerful tool for rapidly styling modern web applications using **utility-first** CSS. This is an approach to styling that uses pre-defined classes to style HTML elements.

When combined with component-based web frameworks (e.g. React, Vue), this issue is minimised.

Tailwind isn't just a quick and effective way of writing CSS; it's also great to build with, due to a variety of development features:

- Easy configuration of the built-in utilities
- Just-in-Time compiler to avoid build times entirely
- Plugins ecosystem (Typography, Forms, etc.)

Official documentation for using Tailwind with Nuxt can be found [here](https://nuxt.com/modules/tailwindcss).

## Installation

Install the package:

```sh
yarn add --dev @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

Add the module to your Nuxt configuration:

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: { enabled: true },
  modules: [
    // ...
    "@nuxtjs/tailwindcss",
    // ...
  ],
});
```

You may optionally create a configuration file:

```sh
npx tailwindcss init
```

And just like that, you can now start adding Tailwind classes to your Nuxt components!

### Prettier integration

If you're using Prettier from earlier in the series, you should also add its Tailwind plugin:

```bash
yarn add --dev prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

This will give you automatic class sorting which is incredibly useful for organisation, especially when using lots of classes in one element (e.g. `hover:`, `dark:`). It should work automatically thanks to Prettier‚Äôs [autoloading convention](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins.html).

## Classes

To get started, add some of Tailwind's in-built utilities to an element's `class` attribute.

```vue
<template>
  <NuxtLink
    to="/"
    class="font-semibold text-gray-50 hover:text-gray-400 duration-100"
  >
    Home
  </NuxtLink>
</template>
```

New to Tailwind? Your best bet is to check out the [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

## Configuration

Create a `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project to configure the default theme.

```ts
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    screens: {
      sm: "640px",
      md: "768px",
      lg: "1024px",
      xl: "1280px",
    },
    extend: {
      colors: {
        linkedin: {
          primary: "#0A66C2",
          lighter: "#378fe9",
          darker: "#004182",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};
```

## Viewer

Nuxt Tailwind exposes a `/_tailwind/` route in development where your Tailwind configuration is rendered as a library.

May your web apps become colourful and flashy üòâ
