## Introduction

### Docker

Docker is a popular tool for packaging and deploying applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on any system with a Docker runtime.

### Amazon ECS

Amazon ECS is a cloud-based container orchestration service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.

### Terraform

Terraform is a tool for defining and managing infrastructure as code.

It allows users to declaratively specify the desired state of their infrastructure and automates the process of provisioning and maintaining that infrastructure.
